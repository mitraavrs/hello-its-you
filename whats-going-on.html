<p class="blurred-text">There was a man and a girl. Their faces looked like they were melting off of their heads. The man was older, much older. They were both the same height, the man and the girl. Tall. Too tall.</p>
<p class="blurred-text">Hands. Hands everywhere, trying to grab at you as youâ€™re free-falling through the dark. Chills down your spine. Something sticky. Something warm.</p>
<p class="blurred-text">Whispers. Your name being called out repeatedly, each time by a different voice. Each voice familiar. Soft, almost imperceptible cries. Tick tick tick.</p>

<p class="blurred-text">Something coppery, tangy, musky, sweet. A complex mix of aromas. It made you want to vomit.</p>
<p class="blurred-text">You woke up choking on your own scream that night.</p>
