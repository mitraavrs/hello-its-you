        <p class="narrate">Fireflies. Stars twinkling in the night sky. Two moons. The mountains off in the distance. My own hand in front of my, holding my torch.</p>
        <p class="narrate">Wind on my skin, biting. My scarf tickling my nose. Cold, wet grass brushing against my ankles. The warmth of my torch, near burning my palm.</p>
        <p class="narrate">Crickets. Gulls in the distance. The squelch of the grass beneath my boots.</p>
        <p class="narrate">Petrichor in the air, from the rain earlier today. My own sweat.</p>
        <p class="narrate">I taste something metallic. </p>
        <p class="narrate">Oh. I bit my lip again.</p>
