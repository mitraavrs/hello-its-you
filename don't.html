        <p class="narrate">There’s a giant clearing about a 1 hour walk from the lighthouse. I don’t like walking that far out. A faint memory of something terrible happening there begs to be let into the forefront of my mind, but I don’t let it. Can’t.</p>
        <p class="narrate">Still, I walk. A masochistic urge to push my body to its limits. I walk as my heart rate slowly spikes, as my breath turns into heaving gasps. </p>
        <p class="narrate">When all is said and done, no matter how much I want to keep it all out, the body keeps score.</p>
        <p class="narrate">I should<a href="just-breathe.html">turn back.</a>I should go.</p>
        <p class="narrate">Back to where it’s safe. Back to where I’m in control.</p>
        <p class="narrate">That’s what I like to think anyway.</p>
        <p class="narrate">I’ve gotten better. At pretending.</p>
